# Python - Inheritance
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essentail concept of programming, specific to the python programming language: superclass, baseclass and subclasses; Utilizing parent classes attributes and methods; overwriting parent classes methods

## Description of wha each file shows:
- tests: Folder holds tests and edge cases checking
- Files that start with:
  1. class that inherits from list and prints sorted list
  2. Function using type() - same object
  3. Function using isinstance() - same class inheritied from
  4. Function usin issubclass() - only subclass of
  5. Empty class BaseGeometry (so next questions can build on this one)
  6. Add area method that's empty
  7. Add integer_validator method
  8. Class REctangle that inherits BaseGeometry; initializes private width, height
  9. Implement str to print
  10. Class Square that inherits Rectangle; initialize size and use area
  11. Implement area and print
  12. 100- Class MyInt that inherits from int; inverts == and != operations
  13. 101- Set attribute to object if possible
