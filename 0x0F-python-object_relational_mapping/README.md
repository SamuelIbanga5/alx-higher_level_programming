# Python - Object relational mapping

An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects that are more commonly used in application code.

ORMs provide a high-level abstraction upon a relational database that allows a developer to write python code instead of SQL to create, read, update and delete data and schemas in their database.
